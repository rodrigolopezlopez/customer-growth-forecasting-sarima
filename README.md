Customer Growth Forecasting using SARIMAThis repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (customer-growth-forecasting-sarima.ipynb) demonstrating a time series forecasting project. The primary goal is to predict future customer growth (visitor reservations) for restaurants using historical data and a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model.Table of ContentsProject OverviewKey HighlightsDatasetData Analysis & PreprocessingForecasting Model (SARIMA)Results & Future WorkRequirementsUsageContributingLicenseProject OverviewThis project forecasts restaurant visitor numbers using historical data and a SARIMA model. Key steps include data loading, cleaning, time series analysis (seasonality), model implementation, and performance evaluation (MAPE).Key HighlightsComprehensive Data Handling: Demonstrated proficiency in loading, cleaning, and transforming raw data from multiple sources for time series analysis.Time Series Analysis: Identified and visualized seasonal patterns (weekly/monthly) in customer visitation data.Predictive Modeling: Applied a SARIMA model for forecasting, showcasing understanding of advanced time series techniques.Critical Evaluation & Problem Solving: Thoroughly evaluated model performance (MAPE) and proposed actionable next steps for improvement, highlighting analytical rigor and strategic thinking.DatasetThree interconnected datasets are used:restaurants_visitors.csv: Visitor reservation details (reserve_visitors as target).store_info.csv: Restaurant details.date_info.csv: Calendar information.Data Analysis & PreprocessingThis phase combined Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Wrangling. Initial data quality checks addressed a date format error. Outliers in reserve_visitors were identified via visualizations. dayofweek and month features were engineered for seasonality. Visitor data was aggregated into a daily time series, and duplicates removed.Forecasting Model (SARIMA)A SARIMA model was chosen for forecasting, leveraging observed seasonality. Data was split into training/test sets. pmdarima.auto_arima identified optimal parameters, using a seasonal period (m=7). The model generated 31-day predictions, with a MAPE of 459.21%.Visualizations:(Here, you would embed your plots. Examples of how you might include them:)Aggregated Visitor Time Series:Visitor Behavior by Month:Actual vs. Predicted Visitors:Results & Future WorkThe SARIMA model's high MAPE (459.21%) indicates limitations, emphasizing iterative development. Future work will focus on:Addressing Data Complexity: Incorporate multiple seasonalities and external factors (holidays, promotions, weather) via SARIMAX using genre_name, area_name, and holiday_flg.Enhanced Data Handling: Implement robust outlier/anomaly handling and advanced feature engineering (lagged values, rolling statistics).Model Exploration: Investigate alternative models like Prophet, ETS, or ML models (XGBoost, LSTMs) if needed.This demonstrates a strong analytical mindset crucial for tackling real-world forecasting challenges.RequirementsTo run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:numpypandasmatplotlibseabornpmdarimastatsmodelsInstall them using pip:pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn pmdarima statsmodels
